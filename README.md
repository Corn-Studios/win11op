## What's New in v1.0.0

### 🚀 Startup Manager
A full startup program manager integrated directly into Win11 Optimizer as a dedicated sidebar tab.

- Reads startup entries from all three standard Windows locations:
  - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` (current user registry)
  - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` (system-wide registry)
  - User and common startup folders
- Enable or disable individual startup entries using the same technique as Windows Task Manager (`StartupApproved\Run` binary key)
- One-click **Enable All** / **Disable All** controls
- Per-entry **impact indicator** (High / Medium / Low) based on known heavy hitters like OneDrive, Discord, Steam, Zoom, and Teams
- Color-coded **source badges** — Registry (User), Registry (System), Startup Folder
- **Delete** entries permanently with confirmation prompt
- Startup folder items handled gracefully — disable is not supported by Windows for folder shortcuts, so the UI explains this and directs to Delete instead
- **Refresh** button to reload the list at any time

### 🎨 Full UI Rework — Corn Studios Design Language
The entire application visual style has been reworked to match the [Corn Studios website](https://corn-studios.github.io) aesthetic.

### Per-Category Undo
Every registry change is backed up before being applied. After running a category, an **↩ Undo Selected** button appears in the bottom bar — click it to fully restore that category to its pre-tweak state. Backups persist across app restarts via `tweaks_backup.json`.

## Notes

- A **reboot is required** after applying tweaks for HAGS, timer resolution, and SMBv1 changes to take full effect
- Bloatware removal cannot be undone — removed apps must be reinstalled from the Microsoft Store
- All registry changes are backed up to `tweaks_backup.json` next to the exe before being applied
- Windows Recall tweaks are a no-op on non-Copilot+ PCs — safe to apply on any hardware
- NVIDIA telemetry tweaks are a no-op if NVIDIA drivers are not installed
- The hosts file block list is cleanly removed by the Privacy undo function
- Startup folder shortcuts cannot be disabled (Windows limitation) — only deleted
